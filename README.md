Web Development, Book Authoring, Industry Reporting, and Design of IP Cores and ICs


Background Information
==============================

As a master of science of one of the top universities in China and as a PhD candidate of several top world universities, I possess sound foundation of semiconductor physics as well as basics of analog and digital ICs and components. I am familiar with the semiconductor components and CMOS processing technologies as well.

I am an experienced chip designer with more than 8 years of design career. I am particularly specialized in FPGA, DSP, SOC and RF design and I am also skilled at designing mixed analog and digital circuits. Since 2009 I entered into the VLSI industry and have designed numerous chips in various industry fields for a number of clients. 

English has been my working language for long and hence my proficiency of English is at the native level. I used to be one of the key personnel in multinationals of the non-silicon industries in earlier days of my career. 


Website Development for the IC Industry
=========================================
I am developing a portal for the IC industry. Its aim is to provide users access to all key development on the research, development, design and manufacturing of IC technologies, that is almost the same thing as the report. Currently the website framework and the key coding are finished. 


Book titled “Silicon IP – More than just Design”
====================================================
This book or rather a platform, a knowledge center, an information hub or an interactive venue on the Internet is being prepared along with my design work. It contains all aspects of the IP core business, industry, technology as well as design process. It will become a book in huge volume - perhaps thousands of pages in A4 size, possibly web based and forever-updated (in the area of IP Core) with an interim title of "Silicon IP – More than just Design". The topic will go far beyond just the design aspect of the IP industry, and it will eventually all major sectors of this business. I will publish a small part of it in document formats such as Word or PDF, and also a small part of it will be made available at my website. But if you want more, you need pay for them.

World IC Technology Development Monthly Report 
==================================================

This report is the only monthly report in the industry that timely reports the progress of various aspects of IC technology worldwide, involving the latest developments in the following areas:

Research on fundamental IC theories - research results of major universities and research institutions (including research institutions affiliated to large companies) in the world;
IC design: new IC design theory, algorithm, language, mode, software (EDA) and platforms, new IC design results
IC product development: development, testing and trial production of model products (before mass production)
IC manufacturing: new manufacturing technologies and new technology nodes (including main processes, materials, equipment, and software)


Authoring
=========================================

I write and publish articles, essays, and posts for various media, web portals and ezines in the areas of integrated circuits, particularly about the latest progress in research, development, design and manufacturing, not just in silicon based ICs, but also in forth coming new generations of IC technologies, such as quantum chips, superconducting chips, DNA computing etc. Special works in some of these areas are also being written, as well as ebooks for education, and publication.


Design of Modem - Modulator & Demodulator - IP Cores
========================================================

My current design focuses on modulation and demodulation IC cores for satellite broadband Internet and wireless communications.I orient myself as one of the top modem (modulation + demodulation) IC designers for satellite broadband Internet. 

I have been concentrating on satellite and wireless communications over the last couple of years, specializing in modulation and demodulation for satellite broadband and wireless communications in the DVB standard series. I have studied satellite and wireless communications over the last couple of years, concentrating on modulation and demodulation for satellite broadband uplink communications in the DVB standard series. I have designed a demodulator IP core based on FPGA and CMOS, and I am preparing for another modem IP core based on probably SDR/DSP etc. In addition I have been preparing for a book called "Modulation and demodulation IC design for satellite communications" with special focus on broadband Internet uplink and LEO satellites operating according to DVB standards. 

My designs are involved in satellite / wireless communications, modulation and demodulation, error correction and coding technologies and some wireless communications technologies, as well as IC design technologies, tools and methodologies. I am developing my modem ICs with the latest reconfigurable technologies based mainly on FPGA. On the FPGA many processing units such as GPU, DSP are integrated which can make the modems compatible with as many communications protocols, standards and modulation schemes as possible. I've developed some separate IPs such as modulators, and demodulators and at the moment I am working on a modulator based in FPGA, HDL and others to cope with several modulation schemes such as BPSK, FSK, MSK, OQPSK, UQPSK  and for DVB S2X applications. The modem IPs are available as proprietorial IP products in the form of HDL codes or binary netlists, which can be integrated into modem blocks of other modem vendors.
The IP cores can be incorporated into various terminals,  indoor and outdoor units and modems on the ground.  IPs available for sale or custom IPs can be designed based upon your specifications and requirements.

Apart from the DVB standards of satellite communiations, my IP core design work has also been spreading to a wider ares of industry standards, among them also including the following:

RDIF for IoT (Internet of Things)
WiFi

Other protocols over IoT:

CELLULAR (5G)
Bluetooth / Bluetooth Low Energy/ Bluetooth LE
Cellular
LoRa/LoRaWan
LTE 
NB-IoT
NFC (Near Field Communication)
UWB
ZigBee  
Z-Wave

Rest of the Communications Protocols:

ATSC	
CDMA
DATA-OVER-CABLE SERVICE INTERFACE SPECIFICATION (DOCSIS)
DTMB	
EDGE	
GPRS
GSM
INTERNET PROTOCOL OVER SATELLITE (IPOS) 
ISDB-T/C/S
J.83B	
TD-SCDMA
WCDMA	
WIMAX	
WLAN	


Design of Other Types of IP Cores
=====================================

And finally, I also can design other types of IP Cores for you as an outsourcer or as a subcontractor, undertaking part of your entire design project, minimizing your cost and time to market and maximizing your  productivity and profit. The range of design is not restricted, and therefoe encompass all major, mainstream chip technologies such as AI, ML, FPGA and others. I will offer you competitive prices while maintaining the quality at the frontiere.


Thank you for your time reading this letter and look forward to hearing from you soon.
