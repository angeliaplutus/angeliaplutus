Web Development

I started my web development career in late 1998, and over that long period of time I have designed and developed hundreds of websites and web applications for commercial corporations, my own businesses, my scientific researches and my private life on the web. 20 years can make everything possible, especially to a man who can learn several times faster than many others. In one word, I can develop any web applications you want. 

Here below are some of the websites which I am developing for my business, personal uses and career, among others.
